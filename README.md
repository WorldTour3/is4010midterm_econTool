##  APIs Used

This tool relies on the following free, no-authentication APIs:

-   **REST Countries API (`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/`):** Used for population, currency, region, and the general list of countries.
-   **World Bank API (`https://api.worldbank.org/v2/`):** Used to fetch GDP and inflation statistics.

Data is retrieved via simple HTTP GET requests. The tool handles cases where data may be missing or APIs are unavailable.
